                shortDesc: `Deriving inspiration from the idea to "Leave it better", 
                    CleanUp MeetUp is a mobile first application that gives users the ability to mark littered areas
                    and organize an effort to clean it up.`,
                longDesc: `A major frustration of mine is seeing trash and debris thrown on the ground, especially at parks, on trails, or around our waterways.
                    I wanted to build an application that would let users mark areas on a map that need some TLC, and which would encourage people clean up those areas.
                    The front end of this application is built with React, Redux, Material-UI, and utilizes the GoogleMaps API. Its powered by a Node.js and Express server that
                    is connected to a PostgreSQL database.`,
